Directory management system based on Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, and Fields

== Description ==

Big Boom Directory is a directory management plugin for WordPress that utilizes Custom Post Types, Taxonomies, and Fields.  The plugin allows you to create a powerful ecosystem within your WordPress site to showcase your listings and the data associated with them.

## Features

* Create and manage custom post types and taxonomies from WP Admin.  Post type settings include:

    * Post type labels
    * WP Admin menu icon and position
    * URL slug and post type name/handle
    * Basic query arguments like 'Posts per page', 'Orderby', and 'Order'
    * Basic post type settings like 'Public' and 'Has Archive', 'Supports', and 'Exclude From Search'
    * Support for REST API using 'show\_in\_rest' and 'rest_base' arguments
    * Use hooks to add your own post type settings

* Add content using the WYSIWYG to act as the post type description for archive pages, and provide an option to show taxonomy term descriptions on term archive pages (for themes that don't do this by default).

* Pick and choose fields from Advanced Custom Fields groups to be displayed on single and archive views.  Compatible with both ACF and ACF Pro.

* Choose image size and alignment for single and archive views with ACF image fields

* Automatically detect URL and social media fields, converting them into links

* Support for ACF and ACF Pro field types like checkboxes, image, date picker, gallery field (with integration using Lightbox), Google Map, oEmbed

* Full-featured advanced search widget with customizable filters and field selection for the search results display

* Use hooks to further customize core functionality like post type editing and registration, front end field display and value processing, and more

== Installation ==

* Go To Plugins >> Add New
* Either search for "Big Boom" or Upload the .zip file downloaded here.
* Once installed, go to the `Directory` admin menu item and create your first post type
* Once you have a post type, you can easily add posts to that post type or create taxonomies associated with your post type
* We recommend using the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields) plugin, which opens up a large set up functionality within Big Boom Directory regarding field placement for the single and archive views for your post types
